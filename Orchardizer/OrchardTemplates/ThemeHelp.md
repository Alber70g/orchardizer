## Videos
- [Getting started with custom themes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk1iJJJ9Itg), Bertrand quietly explaining the ins and outs of theming, few out there who know Orchard better

## Paid
- [Udemy, theming for beginners] (https://www.udemy.com/orchard-cms-theme-development-for-beginners/), I haven't done this course, but it is taught by Abishev who has contributed a lot to the docs (but don't let that put you off!), so he knows his stuff
